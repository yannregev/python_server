<!--Compatibility report 
We have compared our website between google chrome and mozilla firefox.
in our experience, using different browsers does not affect the website's looks and feels, we believe that it is due 
to the fact that html is standardized across all the web browsers.
The difference comes in the printing, firefox doesnt seem to be optimized very well for printing web pages, in the preview page
of firefox the borders of tables seem faded or non existent, even though in the web page the text size was the same. In the print preview
the text size of the paragraphs on firefox was much bigger than on chrome, this resulted in the text taking much more room on the page. 

one thing that worked differently in the browsers was the css widows property, this property only exists on chrome and opera browser
therefore it had no affect in the firefox print preview.

another construct that only exists in chrome, is the orphans property, which also since it does not exist for firefox did not have
any affect in firefox.-->
